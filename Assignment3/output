 Problem 1: Use Newton's method to solve x^3 -x +1/4 = 0 to double precision (eps = 1.0e-16)
 Root x1 =  -1.1071598716887676
 Root x2 =   0.2695944364054446
 Root x3 =   0.8375654352833231

Problem 2&3: Use bracketed search with phi to minimize (x^2-1)^2 -x
 Minimum (x1, y1) = (-1.10716, -1.05617)
 Minimum (x2, y2) = ( 0.83757,  0.92666)

Problem 4&5: Use Levenberg-Marquardt method to fit non-linear model
    c0 = -0.11067871
    c1 =  2.44457006
    c2 = -0.04803953
    c3 =  0.00743662
 Const = -3.94707024
  Chi2 =  9266.58755
