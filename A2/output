 Problem 1: Testing single value decomposition of matrix A(3x3):
   1.000   4.000   7.000
   2.000   5.000   8.000
   3.000   6.000   9.000
 SVD results:     U(3x3)| Sigma(3)| VT(3x3):
  -0.480   0.777   0.408|   16.848| -0.215 -0.521 -0.826
  -0.572   0.076  -0.816|    1.068| -0.887 -0.250  0.388
  -0.665  -0.625   0.408|    0.000|  0.408 -0.816  0.408
 
 Problem 2&3: Fitting noisy data with SVD, n=3. Then computing fit parameters, condition number, and X2.
 Fit complete, results printed csv to be plotted later
 SVD n=3 fit parameters:   -1.170  4.181  2.002  0.711
 Condition number:          2.005
 Chi-squared:            9450.859
 Degrees of freedom:     9126.000
 With the above results, the p-value of the chi-squared statistic is 0.991, making the fit very good.
 
 Problem 4: Fitting noisy data with SVD, n=7. Then computing fit parameters, condition number, and X2.
 Fit complete, results printed csv to be plotted later
 SVD n=7 fit parameters:   -1.170  4.180  2.000  0.711  0.207  0.013 -0.091  0.202
 Condition number:          2.023
 Chi-squared:            9029.101
 Degrees of freedom:     9122.000
 With the above results, the p-value of the chi-squared statistic is 0.250, making the fit poor.
 
 Problem 5: Fitting noisy data with LSS, n=3. Then computing fit parameters, condition number, and X2.
 Fit complete, results printed csv to be plotted later
 LSS n=3 fit parameters:   -1.170  4.181  2.002  0.711
 Condition number:          1.416
 Chi-squared:            9450.859
 Degrees of freedom:     9126.000
 Compared to SVD fit, the LSS fit has a lower condition number, so it's  less sensitive to input errors.
 Fit parameters, chi-squared, and goodness of fit were all identical.
